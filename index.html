                        Hi, my name is Fernando, I've always been into computers! 
                        I built my first computer in middle school and have been a computer nerd ever since. 
                        I enjoy programming and want to make it my career from now on!
                        I currently live in Orlando and wish I could work remotely from here!
                    </p>

                        <li>I am a great team player when I get to work in teams</li>

                <h2>About me!</h2>
                <p>
                    I love spending time learning about programming and design. I could spend hours learning about programming, 
                    if things get hard, I take the time to solve new challenges and learn from others as much as possible.
                    Outside of programming, I spend time with my kids and watching sports. I used to play soccer but now I days I rather 
                    watch sports and listen to music.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am always looking forward to working with others and keep on learning new things that I could use later on in the future. 
                    I am a team player and hope to have an awesome journey learning in thinkful.
